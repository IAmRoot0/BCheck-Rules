# BCheck

## BCheck-Rules

BChecks are custom scan checks that you can create and import. Burp Scanner runs these checks in addition to its built-in scanning routine, helping you to target your scans and make your testing workflow as efficient as possible.

Each BCheck is defined as a plain text file with a .bcheck file extension. These files use a custom definition language to specify the behavior of the check.

This section explains how the BCheck definition language works, with a reference of all available keywords and some worked examples. For information on how to manage BChecks in Burp Suite Professional, including importing definition files and creating new definitions from a template, see BChecks (Burp Suite Professional).
